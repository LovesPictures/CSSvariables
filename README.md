Clock made with vanilla JavaScript

## Guide

The HTML file has 3 `div` elements which correspond with the second, minute, and
    hour hand on a clock

<!-- elements -->
    <div class="hand hour-hand"></div>
    <div class="hand min-hand"></div>
    <div class="hand second-hand"></div>
<!-- elements -->


## Approach

Update the CSS and create a function in Javascript using the classes to get the clock hands to rotate from a central pivot, 
depending in keeping with computer time (?).
